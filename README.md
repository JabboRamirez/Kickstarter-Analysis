According to the chart above, we can conclude that the most successful campaings were kickstarted in the month of may while the ones with the least success runs were in the month december meaning that summer might be best time to start a kickstarter campaign. We can also see that through the months, campaings were cancelled but at a very minimal rate meaning that in general, campaign have a better success rate than being canceled.

Thanks to the analysis  of outcomes based on goals, i was able to find out that from the total number of all successful kickstarters campaigns(theaters/plays), the one with the most success(76% success rate) were campaigns that had a monetary goal of under 1000 dollars. In a close second, campaigns with a monetary goal between 1000 to 4999 dollars, had a success rate of an oustanding 73%. 
Furthermore, as campaign monetary goals were increasing, the success rate was decreasing steadaly.
